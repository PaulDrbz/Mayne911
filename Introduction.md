ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone,

I am Paul (or Mayne, my username) !

Why this username? Simply because Mayne is a nickname I use almost everywhere.

Otherwise, to briefly introduce myself, I am 26 years old and a student at a computer science school. I already have a Master's degree in Information Systems, and I chose to deepen my studies by focusing on development!
The further I go in my studies, the more passionate I become about coding!

On my profile, you will find personal projects aimed at building a small portfolio for future internship, apprenticeship, or "real" job interviews!

What kinds of projects will you find here? For the moment : 

 - Web projects in HTML / CSS / JS
 - Projects in Python, C, or C++

I am at the beginning of my new training and not yet specialized, so for now, I am still a bit "limited" in technologies, but it's coming along!

See you soon!
